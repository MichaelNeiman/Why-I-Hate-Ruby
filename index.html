      <h4>REASONS WHY RUBY IS THE WORST:</h4>
      <div class="haha">

        <h1>Reason #1:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 1 -->

      <img src="./assets/smell.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s stinky. </h2>

<h3> It’s a little known fact that Ruby is a person who smells faintly like old cheese. If you dont believe me, smell her.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Reason #2:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 2 -->
      <img src="./assets/Short.person.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s short. </h2>

      <h3> It's statistically known that short people are worse than tall people. As I am not extremly tall, Ruby being shorter than me is disgusting</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Reason #3:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 3 -->
      <img src="./assets/child.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s a child. </h2>

      <h3> Children are weird and gross. Children are awful and annoying so it is no guess that Ruby is one of them.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
      <h1>Reason #4:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 4 -->
      <img src="./assets/dumb.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s dumb. </h2>

      <h3> Dumb people are stupid. Literally. Now Ruby's one of the stupidest people I know, and I know a lot of dumb people.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
      <h1>Reason #5:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 5 -->
      <img src="./assets/annoy.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Annoying. </h2>

    </div>

    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 6 -->
      <img src="./assets/loud.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s loud. </h2>

      </div>
    </div>
      <h1>Reason #7:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 7 -->

      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s mean. </h2>

      <h3> Ruby at her core, hurts my feelings everyday and is such a hurtful presence. Now one might say this website is mean, but not as mean as her.</h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h1>Reason #8:</h1>
    <div class="Reasons">
      <!-- 8 -->
      <img src="./assets/sike.jpg" alt="Man holding his nose">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>She’s not THAT bad. </h2>
      <h3> Now I've said some hurtful things today, but they might have been a LITTLE exaggerated. Not by much though. </h3>
